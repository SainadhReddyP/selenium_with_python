Encapsulation
-------------
- is the process of wrapping up variables and methods into a single unit.
- encapsulation is a mechanism, which wraps the data (i.e. variables)
and code (i.e. methods) together under a single unit (i.e. Class).

- i.e. In encapsulation, you cannot access data (i.e. variables) as a single unit,
instead we have to take the help of methods to access the data (i.e. variables)

- Encapsulation is achieved by privatizing the variables and accessing them by using
getters and setters methods to modify and get the variable values.

- Binding the data to the class, by making the variables as private and accessing them
only via non-private methods (getter and setter methods)

[see example of getter and setter methods file]
