Classes and Objects
---------------------

Objects
-------
object is a real world entity

examples: pen, mouse, etc.
- we can represent real world entities as Objects in Python.

Classes
--------
class is like a template/blueprint/factory which produces objects.
- with the help of class we can create object

example: cars - class
honda brio, maruti swift, mahindra xuv -> objects

self keyword
------------
- represents something that belongs to the class.
- can be used to access the variables and methods in the same class.
- inside the class we have to use self to access the properties and
outside the class we have to use object reference to access the class properties.
- self parameter can be renamed.
