Static variables, Static methods, Instance variables, Instance methods
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Static variables, Static methods
--------------------------------
- related to class (belongs to Class)
- common properties belongs to Class
Example:
wheels = 4 (every car has 4 wheels) -> static variable
- static variables & static methods belongs to Class memory

- static methods can access the static variables only

- if you want to access instance variables, we can access by creating object for the class,
and use it.

Instance variables, Instance methods
-------------------------------------
- which are related to objects.
- Non-common properties to objects
Example:
color = 'white' (for every car is different) -> instance variable
- Instance variables & Instance methods belongs to Object memory

- Instance methods can access both static and instance variables
