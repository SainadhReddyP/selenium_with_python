> Manual Testing
- Testing will be directly performed by the Software Tester instead of using
any Test Automation Tools.

> Automation Testing
- Testing is performed by Test Automation Tools on behalf of Testers.
Examples: Selenium, UFT, Test Complete, Cypress, Playwright, Tosca, etc.

> How can an Automation Tool perform Testing?
- Testers will do some coding and put the developed code into the Automation tool.
Automation tool will perform testing with the help of the code developed by the
Automation Testers.

> What is Selenium?
- A Test Automation Tool.
- Test Automation automates the testing process and performs the testing

> Different components in Selenium:
- Selenium is not a single tool, it is a set of tools(components).

There are four different components:
1. Selenium IDE (Record and Playback TOol)
We can automate test cases.
- https://www.selenium.dev/selenium-ide/
-
Drawbacks:
- Maintenance is difficult, (more tests & if any step changes we need to record whole test).


2. Selenium RC
- Deprecated

3. Selenium WebDriver
- A library, set of commands

4. Selenium Grid (Part of WebDriver).
- Works along with WebDriver.
- It will distribute automation tests into multiple machines,
- Parallel Execution.
